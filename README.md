# Maze-Solving-Robot-with-ArduinoUNO
This code is for a Maze Solving Robot using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Equipped with three IR sensors and a color sensor, the robot navigates a maze by following black lines. It starts at a green line and stops at a red line indicating the maze's end. DC motors controlled by a motor driver circuit power the robot's movements.
